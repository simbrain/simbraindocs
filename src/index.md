# Documentation for Simbrain 4.0

[Simbrain](https://www.simbrain.net) is a tool for building artificial neural networks that has been developed with the philosophy of ease-of-use and intuitive design. We encourage you to simply launch Simbrain and experiment. For in-depth documentation on each aspect of Simbrain follow the links below. For a quick introduction, see the [Quick Start](docs/quickstart) guide. Simbrain is open source and uses the GNU license. For credits click [here](https://simbrain.net/SimbrainCredits.html).

# What's New in 4.0

Simbrain 4.0 took over a decade to write and has been completely refactored. An overview of the major changes is on the [what's new](docs/whatsnew) page.

# Workspace
The Simbrain [workspace](docs/workspace) is the encompassing framework which contains all simulation components (networks, worlds, etc.), as well as mechanisms for connecting them together via "couplings", scripting, etc. Other general topics concerning simbrain simulations.

# Network
The [network](docs/network) components of Simbrain represents a simulated neural circuit. Networks are the core component of a Simbrain simulation. They are built using a simple graphical interface.

# Worlds
In Simbrain, [worlds](docs/worlds) are components that interact with Network components by giving and/or receiving information. For example OdorWorld simulates a creature's ability to move and smell in a simple two-dimensional world.

# Plots
Use Simbrain [plots](docs/plots) to visualize network activity and other data with Bar charts, Pie Charts, Projections, Time Series, and other charts.

# Simulations
Simbrain includes an environment for building custom [simulations](docs/simulations) in kotlin or java. Can be used to create custom simulations, beyond what the built-in GUI tools provide.

# Evolution
Simbrain includes a framework for [evolving neural netwoks](docs/evolution/).

# Utilities
Simbrain [utilities](docs/utilities) include the [Simbrain console](docs/utilities/terminal.html) and [doc viewer](docs/utilities/docviewer.html).
