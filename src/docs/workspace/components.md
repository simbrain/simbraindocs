# Workspace Components

Components are the main elements of a Simbrain simulation. They are visible as windows in the Simbrain desktop. Neural networks, plots, and virtual environments are examples of components.

When default [update](update.html) is used, at every iteration of the workspace each component is updated. Update can be manually turned off using the Component tab of the [Property Tabs](propertyTabs.html) at the bottom of the Simbrain desktop. A component's GUI representation can also be turned off (but update left on) in order to speed up a simulation.

There are some generic properties that are common to most component types:

<!-- Missing "scripts" page?  https://simbrain.net/Documentation/v3/Pages/Scripting.html -->

- Adding components: To add components press the relevant button on the toolbar, or use the Insert menu. Components can also be added from **scripts**.

- Saving / Opening: Use the save, open buttons and the File menu.  Most components are saved using human-readable xml (using a library called XStream).

- GUI Visibility (settable in the component [Property Tabs](propertyTabs.html)): Whether the component is visible in the desktop.  Making a component invisible can be useful when trying to speed up a simulation.

- Update (settable in the component [Property Tabs](propertyTabs.html)): Whether the component should be updated  when the workspace is iterated.
