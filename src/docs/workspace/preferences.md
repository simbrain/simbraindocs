# Simbrain Preferences

Workspace preferences can be accessed from File > Workspace preferences... These preferences control default behaviors and settings for the Simbrain workspace.

## Workspace Preferences

These preferences are accessible through the workspace preferences dialog:

- **Show info dock by default**: When enabled, the simulation info panel will be shown by default when opening Simbrain or simulations.

- **Show bottom dock by default**: When enabled, the bottom dock (containing Components, Terminal, and Performance tabs) will be shown by default.

- **Bottom dock size**: Size of the bottom dock in pixels. This determines how much vertical space the bottom dock occupies when visible.

- **Simulation directory**: Default directory for opening and saving workspace simulation files (.zip files). By default, points to the `simulations/workspaces` folder.

- **Table directory**: Default directory for importing and exporting tables stored as CSV files. By default, points to the `simulations/tables` folder.

- **Import / export directory**: Default directory for importing and exporting XML files for individual components.

## Network Preferences

Network-specific preferences (such as display colors, default neuron types, etc.) can be accessed from File > Network preferences... See the [Network documentation](../network/) for details.
