# UI and Tools

This section covers the user interface elements, menus, and tools for working with networks in Simbrain. These pages describe how to interact with and configure the network component through its graphical interface.

## Overview

The network component provides a comprehensive set of UI tools for building, editing, and managing neural networks:

- **Menus and Toolbars**: Access to all network operations through menus, toolbars, keyboard shortcuts, and context-sensitive right-click menus
- **Preferences**: Global settings that control network appearance, behavior, and default values across all networks in the workspace
- **Layouts**: Tools for organizing neurons spatially using grid, line, and hexagonal grid patterns
- **Input Tables**: Interactive matrix-based interface for systematically applying input patterns to neurons and observing network responses

These tools work together to provide an efficient workflow for network construction, experimentation, and analysis. Most operations support keyboard shortcuts, work with batch selections, and provide undo/redo functionality.
