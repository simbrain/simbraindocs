# UI and Tools

This section covers the user interface elements, menus, and tools for working with networks in Simbrain. These pages describe how to interact with and configure the network component through its graphical interface.

## Overview

The network component provides a rich set of UI tools for building, editing, and managing neural networks:

- **Menus and Toolbars**: Access to all network operations through keyboard shortcuts, menu items, and toolbar buttons
- **Preferences**: Customizable settings that control network appearance and behavior
- **Layouts**: Tools for organizing neurons spatially in grid, line, and hexagonal patterns
- **Test Inputs**: Interactive tables for systematically testing network responses to input patterns

These tools work together to provide an efficient workflow for network construction and experimentation. Many operations support keyboard shortcuts and batch operations on selected elements.
