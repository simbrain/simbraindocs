# Neuron Arrays and Weight Matrices

Simbrain originated as a way to focus intuition on loose or "free"-standing neurons and their connections, which model neuroscience or else show how the connection to neuroscence works in an intuitive way. However most neural networks software use vectors and matrices to represent neural networks, which make computations far more efficient.

In Simbrain 4 array-based approaches have been incorporated (using [Smile matrix](https://haifengl.github.io/linear-algebra.html) objects), and are integrated in such a way that they can be used alongside all the existing machinery, using similar GUI visualizations. Arrays and matrices provide efficient operations for large-scale neural network simulations and support modern machine learning workflows.

## Neuron Arrays

Neuron arrays are collections of neurons backed by Smile matrices, stored as column vectors. They provide efficient computation for large numbers of neurons while maintaining compatibility with Simbrain's visualization and update systems.

### Display Modes

Neuron arrays can be displayed in multiple ways:
- **Line mode**: Shows neurons as a horizontal or vertical line
- **Grid mode**: Arranges neurons in a rectangular grid
- **Circle mode**: Displays individual neurons as circles
- **Image mode**: Shows activations as a color-coded pixel image

Toggle between these modes using the right-click menu or the GUI tab in the neuron array dialog.

### Array Operations

Neuron arrays support several operations:
- **Layer normalization**: Normalize activations across the array
- **Bias handling**: Each neuron can have an individual bias value
- **Increment/decrement**: Adjust all activations by a fixed amount
- **Clear**: Reset all activations to zero
- **Randomize**: Set activations to random values

## Weight Matrices

Weight matrices represent connections between neuron arrays or neuron groups. They provide efficient matrix-based computation for large-scale networks and support various learning rules and operations.

### Matrix Structure

Weight matrices have dimensions of target size × source size. Each entry represents the connection strength from a source neuron to a target neuron. The matrix supports both excitatory and inhibitory connections, with automatic masking to separate these connection types.

### Matrix Operations

Weight matrices support numerous operations:
- **Diagonalize**: Create an identity-like matrix
- **Randomize**: Fill with random values
- **Randomize symmetric**: Create symmetric random matrices
- **Zero diagonal**: Remove self-connections
- **Clear**: Set all weights to zero

### Mathematical Properties

For square matrices, additional operations are available:
- **Eigenvalues**: Calculate and display eigenvalues
- **Spectral radius**: Set the maximum eigenvalue to control network dynamics

## Creating Arrays and Matrices

An array can be inserted into a Network Window through two methods:

1) Insert > "Add Neuron Array"
2) Pressing the Keyboard shortcut "Y"

Weight Matrices can be added by connecting any two neuron arrays or neuron groups. The simplest way to connect two objects is using the [1-2 trick](./buildingBasics.html#source-and-target-objects).

## Matrix Integration

Simbrain uses efficient matrix operations for array-based computation. This provides:

### Benefits
- Fast computation for large networks
- Efficient memory usage
- Modern neural network compatibility

### Integration with Other Components
Arrays can connect with other network components:
- Neuron groups can connect to arrays via weight matrices
- Arrays can connect to synapse groups
- Mixed neuron and array networks are supported 

## PSR Matrix

The Post-Synaptic Response (PSR) matrix is a key innovation in Simbrain that extends traditional matrix-vector multiplication to support spiking neural networks.

### Traditional vs PSR Computation

In typical neural networks:
- Output = Weight Matrix × Input Vector

In Simbrain, this is split into two steps:
1. **PSR Matrix Creation**: Each row of the weight matrix is element-wise multiplied by the input vector
2. **Summation**: Row sums of the PSR matrix produce the final output

This factorization allows spike responders to modify individual synaptic responses before summation, enabling more biologically realistic computation.

### Spike Response Integration

The PSR matrix can be processed by [spike responders](./spikeresponders.html) before summation, allowing for:
- Non-linear synaptic responses
- Temporal dynamics at individual synapses
- Biologically plausible computation models

### Excitatory and Inhibitory Separation

Weight matrices maintain separate masks for excitatory and inhibitory connections:
- **Excitatory mask**: Binary matrix marking positive weights
- **Inhibitory mask**: Binary matrix marking negative weights

These masks enable separate processing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, which is important for biologically realistic models.
