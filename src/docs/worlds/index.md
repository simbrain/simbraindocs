# Worlds

Worlds are components that interact with Network components by giving and/or receiving information. They provide environmental contexts for neural networks, from simple data storage to virtual environments. All worlds can be [coupled](../workspace/couplings) to networks, for example producing data consumed by neural networks or consuming data produced by neural networks.
